# MyPortfolio
In this Website, I try to show my skills in creating a website from scratch. In this website, I show that I understand how to propertly add an image, header, body, and footer, and show that I also know how to style the website from grabbing specific spots and fixing it how I want it in the end. A fun thing I learned in this week is how to propertly add a direct link to take the user to a specific location without any errors in the end. 

I provide not only my skills, but my information on how I became the person I am today.
