# MyPortfolio
In this updated Portfolio Website, I try to show my skills in creating a website. In this site, I show that I understand how to propertly add an image, header, body, and footer, and show that I also know how to style the website from grabbing specific spots and fixing it how I want it in the end. I added direct links to my resources for additional information.

I provide not only my skills, but my information on how I became the person I am today.
